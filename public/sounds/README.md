## Audio Requirements

- Format: MP3 or WAV
- Duration: 3-10 seconds recommended for sound effects
- Quality: 44.1kHz sample rate, stereo
- Volume: Normalized to prevent audio clipping
- Child-friendly: All sounds should be appropriate for ages 3-6

## Placeholder Implementation

Currently, all audio files are referenced but not included in the repository. 
The sound player will gracefully handle missing files by showing appropriate error states.

For production deployment, actual audio files need to be added to this directory.

## Licensing

All audio files should be:
- Royalty-free or properly licensed
- Appropriate for children's educational content
- Clear and recognizable sounds for each category
